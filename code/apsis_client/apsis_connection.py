class Connection(object):
    """
    This is a (very slim) connection to an apsis server.

    It can be used for a minimum installation of apsis on a worker node,
    for example. It can also be used to start experiments.

    In general, all of the functions defined here take two additional
    parameters:
    blocking : bool, optional
        If True, retries the query until it receives an acceptable answer, at
        most timeout seconds.
        If False, tries the query only once.
        Default is True.
    timeout : float, optional
        The maximum time to retry the connection. If it is <= 0 or None, this
        is interpreted as a an infinitely long wait.
         Default is None.

    Therefore, with the default settings, it is assured that the return of each
    function is a valid value. Otherwise, None may be returned. This means
    that, with the default settings, any program using this class can be
    assured that no extra handling of non-standard answers will be necessary.

    Attributes
    ----------
    server_address : string
        The address (including port) on which the apsis server is reachable.

    repeat_time : float, optional
        The minimum time in seconds between repeat attempts to retry a failed
        request. The real time may be slightly longer.
        Default is 0.1s

        Internal function to handle requests including timeouts and retries.

        In general, the function reattempts a connection as long as the
        time has not been longer than specified by timeout. If blocking, and
        the "result" field of the returned json is None or "failed", both of
        which indicate a non-successful request, the connection is reattempted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        request : requests.request
            The function to use to contact the server. In general, should be
            one of get, post, put, delete etc.
        url : string
            The url of the server, including port. Will ususally consist of
            self.url + some string defining the entry point of the function.
        json : json object, optional

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : string
            name of the experiment.

            String representation of the optimizer.
        param_defs : dict of parameter definitions
            Dictionary representing the parameter definitions. Must have the
            following format:
            For each parameter, one entry whose key is the name of the
            parameter as a string. The value is a dictionary whose "type" field
            is the name of the ParamDef class, and whose other fields are the
            kwarg fields of that constructor.
        optimizer_arguments : dict, optional
            A dictionary defining the operation of the optimizer. See the
            respective documentation of the optimizers.
            Default is None, which are default values.
        exp_id : string or None, optional
            The id of the experiment, which will be used to reference it.
            Should be a proper uuid, and especially has to be unique. If it is
            not, an error may be returned.
        notes : jsonable object or None, optional
            Any note that you'd like to put in the experiment. Could be used
            to provide some details on the experiment, on the start time or the
            user starting it.
        minimization : bool, optional
            Whether the problem is one of minimization. Defaults to True.
        blocking : bool, optional
            If True, retries the query until it receives an acceptable answer,
            at most timeout seconds.
            If False, tries the query only once.
            Default is False.
        timeout : float, optional

                The parameter values this candidate has. The format is
